ENTITY COMMENTS:
1. The word 'Jordan' is incorrectly identified as a Person when the sentences refers to a discovery of crude oil by
the country of Jordan. This should be of entity type GPE (Geopolitical entity) but due to the similarity in the
name of the country and the common first name, this sentence can be challenging for Spacy to parse. Similarly this 
particular garden sentence starts off as if to imply someone named Jordan was to make a crude announcement, hence
it can be initially misleading in true garden-path sentence style.
2. The word 'Londoner' in sentence 5 is identified as a Person however this is James' demonym that is
referring to the fact he is from London, rather than a separate person who is also a Londoner.
