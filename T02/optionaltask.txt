# OPTIONAL TASK: FIBONACCI SEQUENCE:

	Request the user to input a non-negative integer

	If "n" is non-numerical:
		Reprompt the user to input an integer
	If "n" is numerical:
		Store the user input in the integer variable "n"

	Declare a new empty list called "fib" 
	Declare an integer variable called "a" where "a" = 0
	Declare an integer variable called "b" where "b" = 1

	If "n" = 0:
		Append "a" to list "fib"
		Print a concatenation of the string "The Fibonacci sequence is " and the list "fib"
	If "n" = 1:
		Append "a" to list "fib"
		Append "b" to list "fib"
		Print a concatenation of the string "The Fibonacci sequence is " and the list "fib"
	If "n" >= 2:
		Append "a" to list "fib"
		Append "b" to list "fib"

		For element i in range 2 to n:
			Append "c" to list "fib" where c is the difference between the (i-1)th and (i-2)th index values of list "vib"

	Print the list "fib" to the user
